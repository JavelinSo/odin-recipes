    <h3>A <em>must have</em> in every man's cookbook</h3>

    <p>Every man should know how to cook a good steak. While the prefered
        method is open flame, that's not always possible.</p> 
        
        <p>When conditions don't allow an open flame, pan searing in a 
            large cast iron skillet
        is the next best thing. Let's get cooking.</p>

    <h5>Ingredients</h5>

    <ul>
        <li>Steak. prefreably a top sirloin</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh parsley</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Tha's it. Don't get in the way of a good steak by adding a bunch of extra's.</p>

        <ol>Heat remaining butter in cast iron skillet over medium heat</ol>
        <ol>Add steak, cook until disired donenes</ol>
