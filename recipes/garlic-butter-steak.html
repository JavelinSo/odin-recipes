    <h3>A <em>must have</em> in every man's cookbook</h3>

    <p>Every man should know how to cook a good steak. While the prefered
        method is open flame, that's not always possible.</p> 
        
        <p>When conditions don't allow an open flame, pan searing in a 
            large cast iron skillet
        is the next best thing. Let's get cooking.</p>

    <h5>Ingredients</h5>

    <ul>
        <li>Steak. prefreably a top sirloin</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh parsley</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Tha's it. Don't get in the way of a good steak by adding a bunch of extras.</p>

    <h5>Sizzle it up</h5>   
    
        <ol>
            <li>Mix 1 tablespoon butter with parsley, garlic</li>
            <li>Sprinkle steak with salt and pepper</li>
            <li>Heat remaining butter in cast iron skillet over medium heat</li>
            <li>Add steak, cook until desired doneness</li>
        </ol>
<br>

    <p>When contemplating how your steak is cooked, the thermometer should read:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>135 for medium-rare</li>
            <li>140 for meduim</li>
            <li>145 for medium-well</li>
        </ul>


    <p>Anything with a temp higher than 155 should be considered 
        <strong>overcooked</strong> and fed to the <em>dog</em></p>
