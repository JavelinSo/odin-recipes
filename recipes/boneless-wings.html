    <h1>Boneless Wings <strong><em>Are the Superior Wings</em></strong></h1>
    <img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/o19mhvm9a2cm/1dpSvNYewkNkQkPIlQfE1x/d6592d09fd4422c814656fee0b07247a/Website_LTO_Nov2021_Fries_BonelessWings_Buffalo_6PC-1-.png?fm=webp&w=1500" alt="the superior wings">

    <p>There is a tradition in my home, that sunday is for football. And Football Sunday is for fried food. That means boneless wings.</p>

    <p>Why boneless? Because Americans have been bamboozeled by a criminal comspiracy perpetrated by the commercial chicken empire to settle for the left-over chicken parts nobody wants. Americans have been told wings and drumsticks are worth the terrible work-reward ratio. (some scientists have put the number near 459:1) No more my friends. This is America, and by all the Gods I say <strong><em>Boneless Wings are the Superior Wing.</em></strong></p>

    <p>Follow this recipe to the promised land.</p>

    <h3>Get Your Act Together</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>3 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>2 packages Zatarains buttermilk chicken breading</li>
            <li>Lawry's season salt</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Whatcha Gonna Did</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>First, cut up that chicken into wing sized pieces</li>
            <li>Next whisk up them eggs</li>
            <li>Get your Zatarain's, dump it in a big bowl, add the other seasonings as you see fit, You know what <em>you</em> like</li>
            <li>Don't mess around. Kick off is in 45 minutes. It's go time</li>
            <li>Mix all your chicken in with the eggs. Make sure everythings coated real good</li>
            <li>Now bread all that chicken with that sweet Zatarain's mix you got going</li>
            <li>Did you remember to turn the Fryer on? 375 degrees. Get on it Rookie!</li>
            <li>Fry them babies up </li>
            <li>Like Grandpa always said, "When it floats, it's done"</li>
        </ol>

    <p>I highly recommend, if not mandate, you toss these in the wings sauce of your choice, and serve these with some freshy cut Freedom Fries, a cold adult beverage, and enjoy that delish 1:1 work-reward ratio.</p>
